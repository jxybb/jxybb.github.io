I'm passionate about GPU programming, AI accelerator architecture, and optimizing compute performance, especially for deep learning and climate prediction applications. I enjoy exploring hardware architecture to maximize system performance.

As an engineer at Citadel, I authored several technical reports and delivered GTC talks on contemporary AI accelerator microarchitectural details, including Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPUs, as well as the first generation of Graphcore IPUs.

Before joining Citadel, I was a R&D Engineer at Alibaba Cloud, Domain specific computing team. There, I wrote a native assembler for Kepler GPUs and implemented one of the fastest GPU kernels for matrix multiplication and convolution (im2col + gemm).

I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree from Peking university, school of physics, department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. There, I started to program on GPUs since 2012, encouraged and inspired by Prof. Xinyu Wen, with whom I programmed the gpu based dynamic core for PKU atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM).
